# Chess
This program runs a chess game against an AI. The player clicks on the piece they wish to move, which colors the tile the piece is on and the tiles it can move to yellow. Clicking on a valid tile will then move the piece, and clicking an invalid tile or the original tile will deselect the piece. When the player's king is checked, the tile under it will be colored red and the player will be forced to protect the king. The game ends under standard checkmate or stalemate.

The GUI is built using Simple Graphics Library (SGL) by Marty Stepp, which can be found at https://github.com/stepp/sgl
